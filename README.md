# HBNB PROJECT 

HBNB project's purpose is to build an AirBNB clone on my own from scratch, but guided through the different steps thanks to Holberton School curriculus. 

## 1. Technical documentation and UML diagrams 
Files reated to this part can be found in the `part1` directory.

In order to anticipate our coding, we were asked to get familiar with 3 types of UML diagrams : 
- `Highlevel package diagram`
- `Class diagram`
- `Sequence diagrams`

Those three diagrams constitute the technical documentation, informing users about the architecture layers and their depending relations (`package diagram`), class models and their relations (`class diagrams`) and sequences of layers interactions (`sequence diagrams`) in 4 scenarios : user registration, place creation, review submission and list of places request. 

## Work is still in progress, more content will come as the project goes further o/
